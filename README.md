# Hi👋, I'm Ramazan! 
Interesting Back End Development and Software Architectures.


## 🚀 About Me
I am a Back-End developer that is always striving for better. Mostly, I use the .Net Core platform in order to improve my software development skills. I published  and  worked on projects in a variety of software architectures. I generally improved myself in enterprise architectures since I have knowledge and experience at cooperation (n-Layer, Microservice and Onion Architecture, etc.). I have also created Front-End applications using SPA technologies such as Blazor and Angular. Finally, I published my developed applications using Docker. During this process, I also learned a lot about CI/CD.
